This is a repository for MATLAB code which was written for the e-Print article "Information exclusion in quantum measurements and uncertainty relations. Shan Huang, Hua-Lei Yin, Zeng-Bing Chen, and Shengjun Wu. [arXiv:2210.00958 [quant-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00958)."

- [Inf_Bound_Unitary](https://github.com/HS0Git/Information-exclusion/blob/main/Inf_Bound_Unitary.m) - Computes the sum of information gain over arbitrary many random orthonormal bases of finite dimensions and makes comparisons with our upper bound given in Eq. (11) of the main text. This code reduires the free MATLAB toolbox [QETLAB](https://qetlab.com/) to generate random unitaries (bases).
